# Automation Strategy

## Automation Tools/Frameworks

For automating tests, I would use these test automation tools:

1. **Jest + Testing Library:** This combination is well-suited for unit and integration testing, allowing us to efficiently validate individual components and interactions within the application

2. **Cypress:** Cypress is a powerful end-to-end testing tool that can comprehensively validate user flows and critical functionalities within the application.

## Outline for Automation Strategy

1. **Unit Testing with Jest + Testing Library:**

   - Automate unit tests for critical components to validate their functionality.
   - Prioritize testing functions and components that have a high impact on the application's core features.

2. **Integration Testing with Jest + Testing Library:**

   - Automate integration tests to ensure the smooth interaction between different components.
   - Focus on testing component interactions and data flow.

3. **End-to-End Testing with Cypress:**
   - Automate end-to-end tests to validate complete user journeys and core functionalities.
   - Emphasize scenarios that encompass multiple components, such as user registration, login, and content creation.

## Prioritization of Test Cases for Automation

There is a limited number of use-cases in this scenario, so I would prioritize them all, but in the order that corresponds to the most significant value of each use-case for day-to-day app usage. The order would be:

- User Registration and Login
- User Profile Editing
- Posts - Create, Edit, and Deletion (in that order)
- Commenting on Posts

The most important use-case is user registration/login. If those don't work the rest of the application will be made unusable. User profile is at the second place because it contains sensitive information that our application must handle with no issues. Posts are next on the list because successfully creating a post is more important than creating a post comment, which has to be the last priority on this list.

# Bug Reporting

# Performance Testing Strategy

## Approach to Performance Testing

A basic approach to performance testing would involve the following steps:

1. **Identify Critical User Scenarios:** Prioritize user scenarios based on their significance, such as user registration, login, and content creation. These scenarios are essential for user engagement.

2. **Define Performance Metrics:** Establish performance metrics, such as response time, load time, and server response time, to measure application performance.

3. **Baseline Testing:** Conduct baseline tests to measure the application's current performance under typical user loads.

4. **Stress Testing:** Simulate high loads by sending a large number of simultaneous requests to the application. Observe how the system handles increased traffic and whether it maintains acceptable performance levels.

5. **Load Testing:** Gradually increase the user load on the application to evaluate its performance under different levels of stress.

## Prioritization and Recommendations

1. **User Registration and Login:** Prioritize performance testing for user registration and login since these are crucial entry points. Ensure that user authentication processes are responsive and can handle a surge in requests.

2. **Content Creation:** Content creation (e.g., creating posts and comments) should be tested to assess the application's capacity to handle data interactions. Check for bottlenecks in data storage and retrieval.

3. **Database and Server Load:** Identify potential bottlenecks related to the database and server load. Optimize database queries, indexing, and server-side caching to enhance response times.

4. **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce server load, especially for frequently accessed data, and reduce the need for repeated database queries.

5. **Content Delivery:** Use a content delivery network (CDN) to optimize the delivery of static assets (e.g., images, CSS, and JavaScript), reducing the load on the application server.

6. **Scalability:** Plan for application scalability to handle increased user loads. Consider load balancing and cloud-based solutions to distribute traffic efficiently.

7. **Monitoring and Reporting:** Implement monitoring and reporting tools to continuously assess the application's performance. Set up alerts for unusual spikes in server load or response times.
